            <h2>What are Near-Earth Objects?</h2>
            <p>NEOs are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earth's neighborhood. This is a site that tracks and presents data on these objects, offering insights into their size, distance, and potential risks.</p>
