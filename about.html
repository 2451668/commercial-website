            <h1>About Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)</h1>
            <p>
                Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them close to Earth. These celestial bodies can range in size from a few meters to several kilometers. While most NEOs pose no threat to Earth, their proximity makes them important subjects of study for both scientific and safety reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                NEOs have fascinated scientists and astronomers for decades, primarily due to their potential to collide with Earth. While the majority pass safely by, some are classified as "Potentially Hazardous Asteroids" (PHAs) because of their size and their potential to come close enough to Earth to warrant concern. Monitoring and understanding these objects is critical for planetary defense and advancing our knowledge of the early solar system.
            </p>

            <h2>Why NEOs?</h2>
            <p>
                The exploration of NEOs is not only fascinating, but it also holds significant value for the safety of our planet- to create awareness about these objects and to visualize the data that helps track their movements. By making this information accessible and easy to understand, it may serve to foster greater understanding of NEOs and the scientific efforts behind tracking them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using easy data visualizations helps in highlighting the importance of monitoring NEOs and how their orbits intersect with Earth's path. This helps to bridge the gap between complex scientific data and public understanding, offering users an interactive way to engage with real-time data on NEOs.
            </p>

            <h2>The Importance of NEO Monitoring</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, monitoring NEOs is crucial for several reasons. Understanding their paths helps us predict future orbits and potential Earth impacts. The study of NEOs also provides insights into the early solar system, as many of these objects are remnants from its formation. Finally, monitoring NEOs is vital for developing early warning systems that can help protect our planet from possible future collisions.
